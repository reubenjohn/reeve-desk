# Goals: Your North Star

This file defines your long-term objectives - the "why" behind your daily activities. These are the outcomes that matter most to you.

**How to use this file:**
- Keep it short (3-5 active goals maximum)
- Make goals specific and measurable when possible
- Review and update quarterly or when priorities shift
- Reeve will reference these daily to help you stay aligned

**Format:**
Each goal should have:
- **Title** - Clear, concise name
- **Why** - The deeper reason this matters to you
- **Success Criteria** - How you'll know you achieved it
- **Status** - Active, On Hold, Completed, Cancelled
- **Target Date** - When you want to achieve this (if applicable)

## Active Goals

### 1. Build a Consistent Fitness Routine

**Why this matters:**
I want to feel strong, energized, and confident in my body. Regular exercise improves my mood, sleep quality, and overall health. This isn't about perfection—it's about showing up consistently and building a sustainable habit that fits my life.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Exercise 3-4 times per week for 3 consecutive months
- [ ] Find 2-3 activities I genuinely enjoy (not just "should do")
- [ ] Notice improved energy levels and sleep quality
- [ ] Feel stronger and more capable physically
- [ ] Exercise becomes part of my routine, not a chore

**Target Date:** 2026-04-30 (3-month habit formation)

**Status:** 🎯 Active

**Current Actions:**
- Identifying activities I enjoy (walking, yoga, strength training, sports, etc.)
- Starting with realistic frequency (2-3x/week to start)
- Tracking how I feel after workouts to find what works

### 2. Improve Sleep Quality & Consistency

**Why this matters:**
Good sleep is the foundation of everything—my mood, energy, decision-making, and physical health. I want to wake up feeling rested and ready, not groggy and struggling. Consistent sleep will help me show up better for everything else in my life.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Sleep 7-8 hours per night consistently (5+ nights/week)
- [ ] Establish a consistent bedtime routine
- [ ] Reduce time spent scrolling before bed
- [ ] Wake up feeling refreshed (not hitting snooze repeatedly)
- [ ] Notice improved mood and energy during the day

**Target Date:** 2026-03-31 (2-month habit building)

**Status:** 🎯 Active

**Current Actions:**
- Setting a target bedtime and wake time
- Identifying sleep disruptions (screen time, caffeine, stress, etc.)
- Creating a wind-down routine (what helps me relax?)

### 3. Develop Healthier Eating Habits

**Why this matters:**
Food is fuel, but it's also pleasure and self-care. I want to nourish my body with foods that make me feel good—more energy, better digestion, stable mood. This isn't about restriction or dieting; it's about making choices that support my wellness and actually enjoying what I eat.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Eat balanced meals most days (protein, veggies, healthy fats)
- [ ] Cook at home more often (reduces reliance on takeout)
- [ ] Stay hydrated (water throughout the day)
- [ ] Notice improved energy and digestion
- [ ] Develop a few go-to healthy meals I actually enjoy

**Target Date:** Ongoing (lifestyle change, not deadline)

**Status:** 🎯 Active

**Current Actions:**
- Meal planning or prep (even simple prep helps)
- Finding quick, healthy recipes I enjoy
- Keeping healthy snacks accessible
- Tracking hydration (simple water bottle habit)

## Goal-Setting Guidelines

**Good Goals:**
- ✅ "Complete marathon training and run a sub-4-hour marathon by June"
- ✅ "Ship Reeve MVP with autonomous Telegram integration by Feb 1"
- ✅ "Read 24 books this year (2 per month)"

**Poor Goals (Too Vague):**
- ❌ "Be healthier"
- ❌ "Work on personal projects"
- ❌ "Learn more"

**Connection to Daily Life:**
When Reeve wakes up each day, it will:
1. Read this file to understand your priorities
2. Frame daily tasks in terms of these goals
3. Celebrate progress and milestones
4. Suggest actions that align with goals

**Example:**
If you have a goal "Run a marathon by June", Reeve might:
- Remind you of training runs: "Long run today - Week 8 of your marathon plan!"
- Protect recovery time: "You've run 4 days straight, recommend rest day tomorrow"
- Celebrate milestones: "🎉 Hit 20 miles! That's your longest run yet. Marathon goal is 65% complete."
