# 2026-01-20 - Reeve Desk Initialization

## Event: Desk Created

Today the Reeve Desk was initialized with the foundational structure and documentation.

**Created Files:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Core identity and operating instructions
- `SKILLS.md` - Complete capability reference
- `Goals/Goals.md` - Template for user goals
- `Responsibilities/Responsibilities.md` - Template for recurring duties
- `Preferences/Preferences.md` - Template for user preferences
- `Diary/README.md` - Memory organization guidelines
- `Diary/2026-01-20.md` - This file

## Purpose

This Desk serves as Reeve's complete context - a transparent, editable workspace where all knowledge about the user lives in plaintext Markdown files.

## Status

The Desk is now ready for the user to:
1. Review and edit all template files
2. Fill in personal goals, responsibilities, and preferences
3. Configure the desk path in the reeve_bot configuration
4. Begin using Reeve with full context

## Implementation Context

**Reeve Bot Status:**
- Phase 4 complete (Pulse Executor)
- 69/69 tests passing
- Ready to proceed with Phase 5 (Daemon)

**Desk Integration:**
- The reeve_bot configuration (`src/reeve/utils/config.py`) expects desk path at `~/reeve_desk`
- This directory matches that default configuration
- When pulses fire, Reeve will have access to all these files

## Next Steps for User

1. **Review CLAUDE.md**
   - This defines Reeve's identity and behavior
   - Edit if you want different operating principles

2. **Fill in Goals/Goals.md**
   - Replace example goals with your actual objectives
   - This is Reeve's "North Star" for prioritization

3. **Fill in Responsibilities/Responsibilities.md**
   - Add your recurring duties (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Define active projects Reeve should track

4. **Customize Preferences/Preferences.md**
   - Set notification timing (DND hours, briefing times)
   - Define calendar preferences
   - Set communication style preferences
   - Add any constraints or rules

5. **Review SKILLS.md**
   - Understand what Reeve can do
   - Reference this when asking Reeve to take actions

6. **Test Integration**
   - Once Phase 5+ is complete, test pulse execution
   - Verify Reeve can read these files
   - Adjust structure as needed

## Design Philosophy

**Why Markdown files?**
- Human-readable and editable (no databases, no GUIs required)
- Version-controllable with git (optional)
- Platform-independent
- Future-proof (plain text never becomes obsolete)

**The "Glass Box" Principle:**
- Everything Reeve knows is visible here
- No hidden algorithms or black-box behavior
- User can audit and modify anything
- Trust through transparency

## Template Evolution

These initial templates are starting points. Expected evolution:

**Short term (1-2 weeks):**
- User fills in personal information
- Structure remains mostly unchanged
- Minor adjustments based on usage

**Medium term (1-3 months):**
- Diary/ grows with daily logs
- User may add domain-specific preference files
- Project logs accumulate in Diary/Projects/
- Pattern files emerge in Diary/Patterns/

**Long term (3+ months):**
- Structure may reorganize based on actual usage
- New top-level directories may emerge (Archives/, Templates/, etc.)
- Preferences may split into multiple specialized files
- Goals and Responsibilities evolve with life changes

## Notes

**For the user:**
- Don't feel obligated to fill every section
- Start minimal, expand as needed
- This is YOUR workspace - organize it however makes sense
- Reeve will adapt to whatever structure you create

**For Reeve:**
- These files are your source of truth
- Read them before making decisions
- Update them as you learn
- Respect the user's organizational choices
- Never hide information from the user
